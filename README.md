# NAND Game

[NANDgame.com](https://nandgame.com) - Olav Junker Kjær

This game is a nerd's dream! Starting with a couple of relays and building the
component library incrementally, the levels of the game challenge you to create
various functionality that exists within computing. The user interface allows
you to see the flow of current through your components as you try to build more
complex systems. Unfortunately, having solved all the levels in the past (except
the final one - it was broken at the time!), the website has not retained my
solutions. Thus, I am working my way through the entire game once more and
documenting the optimal solutions as I go.

All the flowcharts use the
[Mermaid Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)
and they also render on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/DaveyJH). However, the
GitHub mobile app will not render these! If you fancy a gruelling bit of
self-punishment, feel free to try and decipher the code - if you ignore the
`linkstyles` toward the end of each chart it isn't too difficult to work out
what is going on, but I wouldn't choose to view it that way! Plus, you won't see
the current flow through the various permutations so I highly recommend viewing
this on a desktop or via a web browser on a mobile.

Each markdown file consists of the name of the component/functionality, a logic
table showing the various inputs and outputs, a brief explanation of that logic,
every permutation of inputs and their resulting outputs, and finally a
simplified representation of the component or function.

Why do I do this to myself, you ask...because I love flowcharts, I love logic,
and I think this is really cool! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
